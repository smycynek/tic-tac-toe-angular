# tic-tac-toe-angular
A simple tic-tac-toe game using AngularJS and a few functional and closure programming concepts.  
I'm not very familiar with DOM events in Angular, so some of the code to get a table cell, etc... 
is far from ideal, but I'm working on it.

*  Node users, just use 'npm install' and './bin/www'
